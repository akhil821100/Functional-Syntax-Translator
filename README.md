# Functional-Syntax-Translator
This program named functional syntax converter can convert the functional syntax axioms to their equivalent description logic syntax axioms. 
An OWL API has been used to parse the axioms. 
The program also checks the syntax validity of the input axioms before translating them and gives the appropriate error message in case of invalid syntax.
